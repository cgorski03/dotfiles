# Colin's Dotfiles

Hi, this is my dotfiles repo. Its for me, so its poorly documented and changes often.

## What's In Here

### Terminal & Shell

- **zsh**
- **ghostty**
- **tmux**

### Editor & Git

- **nvim** - neovim setup, no crazy plugings
- **git** - git config and aliases

### Window Management (macOS)

- **yabai** - Tiling window manager. Auto-arranges windows and spaces
- **skhd** - Hotkey daemon used for yabai
- **raycast** - Spotlight replacement

## Random Notes

- Most configs are pretty minimal, I try to avoid wasting as much time as i know i could in here
