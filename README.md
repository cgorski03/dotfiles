## How Windows Work

### Basic Setup
I have yabai set up so windows automatically arrange themselves in a nice grid pattern. New windows appear to the right or bottom of whatever I'm currently looking at. There's just a tiny 2px gap between windows.

### Special Windows
- System Settings - always needs to be accessible
- Messages - I want this to stay visible, i control it with raycast 

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Moving Around Windows
- `Alt + Shift + I/K/J/L` - Jump focus to window above/below/left/right 
- `Alt + I/K/J/L` - Actually swap window positions

### Multiple Monitors
- `Alt + Shift + W/S/D/A` - Jump between different screens
- `Alt + W/S/D/A` - Move a window to another screen and follow it there

### Virtual Desktops (Spaces)
- `Alt + Q/E` - Move window to previous/next desktop and go there
- `Alt + Shift + Q/E` - Just switch desktops without moving windows
- `Alt + Shift + Delete` - Delete empty desktops

### Other Window Stuff
- `Alt + Shift + U/O` - Make current window wider/narrower
- `Alt + Shift + Return` - Flip the entire desktop upside down
- `Alt + Shift + Z` - Restart yabai
